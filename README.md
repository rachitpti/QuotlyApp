# QuotlyApp

- This is an application that is a part of iOS Development workshop series.
- Made in collaboration with ACM @ UC Riverside for Rosehack 2024.
- You can also use this code as a reference in our workshop too.
  
- I've attached resources below for our workshop :)
- Quotes API link:- https://zenquotes.io/api/quotes (the data we will be using is (q = quote, a = author)
- To accelerate our iOS Development we used https://quicktype.io which will produce a Swift object arrangement for us based on the JSON structure. 
  
- Happy Swift Coding 👩‍💻👨‍💻
